# simCLR
A SimCLR implementation for self-supervised learning from unlabeled data

We use the SSL4EO-S12 (just the RGB channel) unlabeled dataset to learn the pretext task and for the down-stream task, we use a subset of the Eurosat (RGB channel) data. We use the simCLR based pipeline for the self-supervised learning task.
